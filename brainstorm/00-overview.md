## Open Threads

- Should `identity.spiffe.trustDomain` and `identity.binding.trustDomain` be unified? (from #02)
- Should binding evaluation in the AgentRuntime controller use `status.card` data or re-evaluate independently? (from #02)
- Is there a need for namespace-level binding policy via ConfigMap? (from #02)
- Should the `AgentCardSyncReconciler` get its own deprecation warning before removal? (from #02)
- Should the controller emit a warning event when custom egress rules are set but the agent is unverified? (from #03)
- How should the controller handle the transition period where AgentCards still own NetworkPolicies? (from #03)
- Should `spec.networkPolicy` support future extension, or use a narrower field name like `spec.egressPolicy`? (from #03)
- What is the exact current state of `mtlsMode` support in proxy-sidecar mode? (from #04)
- Does the controller's verified fetch fallback correctly set status conditions today? (from #04)
- What SPIRE version and configuration is assumed for the CI cluster? (from #04)
- Are there cert rotation edge cases (SVID expiry during active connections) that need explicit coverage? (from #04)
- Should `ControlPlaneMTLS` be set on AgentRuntime or AgentCard, given `AttestedAgentSpiffeID` already lives on AgentCard? (from #05)
- What happens to the condition when SPIRE is temporarily unavailable (grace period vs flapping)? (from #05)
- How does `DataPlaneMTLS` interact with existing injection-related conditions? (from #05)
- Should the SPIFFE ID in the condition message be full URI or workload identifier only? (from #05)
