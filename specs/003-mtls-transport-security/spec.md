# Feature Specification: mTLS Transport Security for Agent Communication

**Feature Branch**: `003-mtls-transport-security`
**Created**: 2026-06-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Brainstorm document `specs/003-mtls-transport-security/brainstorm.md`
**ADR**: ODH-ADR-AgentOps-0002 — Agent Network Policy and mTLS Identity
**Jira**: RHAIENG-4944 — Agent Discovery via mTLS
**Parent Feature**: RHAISTRAT-1599 — Productize & Downstream the Agent Operator
**Target Release**: rhoai-3.5.EA2

## Scope

Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) as the default transport security layer for two communication paths in the Kagenti platform:

1. **Controller-to-agent** — the operator controller fetching agent cards and verifying agent identity over mTLS
2. **Agent-to-agent** — inter-agent calls where both sides prove identity via SPIRE-issued X.509 certificates

All status updates (transport security, attested SPIFFE ID, mTLS readiness conditions) are written to **AgentRuntime status**, not AgentCard.

### Out of Scope

- Istio integration — no Istio dependency; SPIRE is the sole mTLS provider
- User-supplied certificates and cert-manager — deferred to a future iteration
- `spec.policy` enforcement (NetworkPolicy, AuthorizationPolicy) — separate spec
- AgentCard CRD removal — separate migration spec
- Cross-cluster agent federation — future work
- Bearer token / OAuth2 authorization — handled by authbridge, orthogonal to mTLS
- Downstreaming logistics for kagenti-extensions — separate spike
- Webhook injector changes — existing spiffe-helper injection is sufficient

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-06-03

- Q: What sidecar mode should mTLS target? → A: All sidecar modes (envoy, proxy-sidecar, lite, waypoint). mTLS must be sidecar-agnostic.
- Q: What certificate sources should be supported? → A: SPIRE only. No Istio dependency.
- Q: How should the controller obtain its SPIFFE identity? → A: go-spiffe SDK directly in the controller binary (already implemented via SpiffeFetcher).
- Q: How should mTLS be enforced? → A: Enabled by default (permissive). Disabled is opt-in per-AgentRuntime.
- Q: How should certificates reach the data-plane sidecar? → A: spiffe-helper sidecar (file-based). Keeps proxy certificate-source-agnostic.
- Q: What happens when mTLS is enabled but SPIRE is not deployed? → A: Fail clearly. Error condition on AgentRuntime; operator must deploy SPIRE or set mTLSMode: disabled.

## Current State — What Already Exists

### Authbridge (kagenti-extensions) — DONE

mTLS is fully implemented in authbridge across all three proxy modes on main:

- `authlib/tls/server.go` — `ServerConfig()` for mTLS reverse-proxy listener (inbound)
- `authlib/tls/client.go` — `ClientConfig()` for mTLS forward-proxy dialer (outbound)
- `authlib/spiffe/source.go` — `X509Source` interface abstracting SPIFFE credentials
- `authlib/spiffe/provider.go` — File-based provider reading from spiffe-helper PEM files
- `authbridge-proxy/main.go` — Full mTLS wiring: `cfg.MTLS` → `MTLSOptions` → listeners
- `authbridge-lite/main.go` — Same mTLS wiring as proxy (size-optimized variant)
- Permissive mode: inbound byte-peek TLS-sniffing, outbound plaintext
- Strict mode: inbound rejects non-TLS, outbound TLS-or-fail
- Per-handshake certificate rotation from spiffe-helper files
- `authtls.Metrics` for TLS handshake observability

### Operator (kagenti-operator) — Partially Done

- `MTLSMode` field on `AgentRuntimeSpec`: enum with values `disabled`, `permissive`, `strict` (defaults to `disabled`)
- `CardStatus` struct on `AgentRuntimeStatus`: includes `TransportSecurity`, `AttestedAgentSpiffeID`, `ValidSignature`
- `SpiffeFetcher` in `internal/agentcard/fetcher.go`: mTLS-authenticated fetch using go-spiffe X509Source
- `--enable-verified-fetch` flag gates mTLS fetch (default: `false`)
- `--enable-card-discovery` flag gates card discovery into `status.card`
- Webhook injector auto-injects spiffe-helper when `mTLSMode` is non-disabled

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 — Agent-to-Agent mTLS by Default (Priority: P1)

A platform operator deploys two agents. Without any mTLS-specific configuration, both agents communicate over mTLS automatically because SPIRE is deployed and mTLS defaults to permissive.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value — mTLS should just work without manual configuration when the infrastructure (SPIRE) is present.

**Independent Test**: Deploy two agent workloads with SPIRE, create AgentRuntimes (no explicit `mTLSMode`), and verify inter-agent calls use mTLS by checking authbridge logs for TLS handshake entries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two AgentRuntimes with no explicit `mTLSMode` set and SPIRE deployed in the cluster, **When** agent A calls agent B, **Then** the authbridge sidecar establishes an mTLS connection using SPIRE-issued SVIDs and both agents' SPIFFE IDs are verified against the trust bundle.
2. **Given** an AgentRuntime with `mTLSMode: disabled`, **When** agent A calls this agent, **Then** the authbridge sidecar accepts plaintext HTTP connections (no TLS required).
3. **Given** an AgentRuntime with `mTLSMode: strict`, **When** a plaintext HTTP request arrives, **Then** the authbridge sidecar rejects the connection.

### User Story 2 — Controller-to-Agent Communication over mTLS (Priority: P1)

The operator controller communicates with agent workloads over mTLS by default when SPIRE is available. When fetching the A2A agent card from the live agent endpoint (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`), the controller uses mTLS to verify the agent's identity. The verified SPIFFE identity and transport security metadata are recorded in `AgentRuntime.status.card`. The AgentCard CRD is not involved — the controller talks directly to the agent workload and writes results to AgentRuntime status.

**Why this priority**: Controller-to-agent identity verification is a core security requirement. The SpiffeFetcher already exists; this wires it as the default.

**Independent Test**: Deploy an agent with SPIRE identity, create an AgentRuntime, and verify `status.card.transportSecurity` is `mtls` and `status.card.attestedAgentSpiffeID` contains the agent's SPIFFE ID.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AgentRuntime targeting a workload with SPIRE identity and the controller has access to the SPIRE Workload API, **When** the controller reconciles the AgentRuntime, **Then** the A2A agent card is fetched from the live endpoint over mTLS and `AgentRuntime.status.card.transportSecurity` is `mtls`.
2. **Given** an AgentRuntime targeting a workload with SPIRE identity, **When** the controller fetches the A2A agent card over mTLS, **Then** `AgentRuntime.status.card.attestedAgentSpiffeID` contains the SPIFFE ID extracted from the peer certificate.
3. **Given** a controller without SPIRE configured (no Workload API socket), **When** the controller reconciles an AgentRuntime, **Then** the A2A agent card is fetched over plain HTTP and `AgentRuntime.status.card.transportSecurity` is `http`.

### User Story 3 — Clear Error When SPIRE Is Unavailable (Priority: P1)

An operator deploying agents without SPIRE but with mTLS defaulting to enabled gets a clear error condition explaining what's wrong and how to fix it.

**Why this priority**: Fail-clearly prevents silent security gaps. Operators must know when mTLS isn't active.

**Independent Test**: Create an AgentRuntime in a cluster without SPIRE and verify the `MTLSReady` condition is `False` with reason `SPIREUnavailable`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an AgentRuntime with `mTLSMode: permissive` (the default) and no SPIRE deployed, **When** the controller reconciles, **Then** `status.conditions` includes `MTLSReady=False` with reason `SPIREUnavailable` and message `"mTLS requires SPIRE; either deploy SPIRE or set mTLSMode: disabled"`.
2. **Given** an AgentRuntime with `mTLSMode: disabled`, **When** the controller reconciles in a cluster without SPIRE, **Then** `MTLSReady=True` with reason `MTLSDisabled` (mTLS is explicitly opted out — no error).
3. **Given** an AgentRuntime with `MTLSReady=False` and SPIRE is subsequently deployed, **When** the controller reconciles, **Then** `MTLSReady` transitions to `True`.

### User Story 4 — JWS Signing Pipeline Deprecation Warning (Priority: P2)

Operators using the legacy JWS signing pipeline receive deprecation warnings directing them to mTLS as the replacement.

**Why this priority**: Signals the migration path without breaking existing setups.

**Independent Test**: Start the operator with `--require-a2a-signature=true` and verify deprecation warnings in the logs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the operator is started with `--require-a2a-signature=true`, **When** the operator boots, **Then** a deprecation warning is logged: `"--require-a2a-signature is deprecated; mTLS replaces JWS card signing. This flag will be removed in a future release."`.
2. **Given** the operator is started with `--signature-audit-mode=true`, **When** the operator boots, **Then** a similar deprecation warning is logged.
3. **Given** the operator is started with none of the legacy signing flags, **When** the operator boots, **Then** no deprecation warnings are logged.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the spiffe-helper is slow to write initial SVIDs? The authbridge proxy blocks at startup until certificates are available (`WaitForCredentialFile` in `authlib/config/resolve.go`). The kubelet restart policy handles prolonged failures.
- What happens when an agent with `mTLSMode: strict` tries to call an agent with `mTLSMode: disabled`? The outbound mTLS handshake fails because the target doesn't present a TLS listener. The authbridge logs the handshake failure. This is expected — strict callers cannot reach non-TLS targets.
- What happens when `mTLSMode` changes on a running AgentRuntime? The ConfigMap hash changes, triggering a rolling restart of the workload. The new sidecar boots with the updated mTLS config.
- What happens during SVID rotation? The authbridge's per-handshake callbacks re-read certificates from disk on every TLS handshake. Rotation is transparent — no restart, no connection drop.
- What happens in a mixed-mode deployment (some agents permissive, some strict)? Permissive agents accept both TLS and plaintext inbound. Strict agents reject plaintext. Permissive outbound is plaintext — a permissive caller cannot reach a strict target. For full mesh mTLS, all agents should be strict.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST default `mTLSMode` to `permissive` when not explicitly set on an AgentRuntime CR.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST include an `mtls:` block in the authbridge sidecar ConfigMap when `mTLSMode` is `permissive` or `strict`, with the mode value matching the AgentRuntime field.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST NOT include an `mtls:` block in the authbridge sidecar ConfigMap when `mTLSMode` is `disabled`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST set an `MTLSReady` condition on AgentRuntime status indicating whether mTLS infrastructure (SPIRE) is available.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST use `SpiffeFetcher` (mTLS) as the default card fetcher when the controller has access to the SPIRE Workload API socket.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST fall back to `DefaultFetcher` (plain HTTP) when SPIRE is not configured on the controller pod.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST record `status.card.transportSecurity` as `mtls` or `http` on AgentRuntime to indicate which transport was used for the card fetch.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST record `status.card.attestedAgentSpiffeID` on AgentRuntime with the SPIFFE ID extracted from the peer certificate when the card is fetched over mTLS.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST trigger a rolling restart of the workload when `mTLSMode` changes (via ConfigMap hash change).
- **FR-010**: The system MUST log deprecation warnings at operator startup when legacy JWS signing flags (`--require-a2a-signature`, `--signature-audit-mode`, `--enforce-network-policies`) are set to `true`.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST default legacy JWS signing flags to `false`.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST change the `--enable-verified-fetch` flag default to `true` (kill switch retained for one release cycle).

### Key Entities

- **AgentRuntime**: Existing CRD extended with mTLS defaults. `spec.mTLSMode` controls transport security. `status.card` holds transport security metadata. `status.conditions` includes `MTLSReady`. All mTLS-related status goes here, NOT on AgentCard.
- **Authbridge ConfigMap**: Per-namespace ConfigMap consumed by the authbridge sidecar. Operator populates the `mtls:` block based on `mTLSMode`.
- **SPIRE**: External dependency providing X.509 SVIDs via the Workload API. Must be deployed for mTLS to function.
- **spiffe-helper**: Sidecar container that fetches SVIDs from SPIRE and writes PEM files to a shared volume. The authbridge proxy reads these files.
- **SpiffeFetcher**: Existing component in `internal/agentcard/fetcher.go` that performs mTLS-authenticated card fetches using go-spiffe X509Source directly.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Agents deployed with SPIRE communicate over mTLS by default without explicit `mTLSMode` configuration.
- **SC-002**: The controller fetches agent cards over mTLS by default when SPIRE is available, with the transport security and attested SPIFFE ID visible in `AgentRuntime.status.card`.
- **SC-003**: Operators without SPIRE see a clear `MTLSReady=False` condition with actionable guidance.
- **SC-004**: Existing deployments using JWS signing see deprecation warnings and continue functioning during the transition period.
- **SC-005**: mTLS works across all authbridge sidecar modes (envoy, proxy-sidecar, lite).

## Assumptions

- SPIRE is deployed in the cluster and the SPIRE agent socket is accessible to both the controller pod and agent workload pods.
- The authbridge mTLS implementation in kagenti-extensions (on main) is stable and tested.
- Each agent workload has exactly one Pod (one-agent-per-pod model), so pod identity equals agent identity (SPIFFE ID).
- The spiffe-helper sidecar is already injected by the webhook when `mTLSMode` is non-disabled — no changes to injection logic are needed.
- The authbridge ConfigMap schema supports the `mtls:` block with `mode:` field as documented in the authbridge code.
